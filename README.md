# 📊  Retention

## 🔰 Introduction
User retention plays a pivotal role in evaluating the success and longevity of digital platforms. This project visualizes and analyzes retention patterns by comparing behaviors between **feature adopters** and **non-adopters**, offering actionable insights into user engagement and subscription dynamics.

---

## 🧾 Project Overview
Using SQL and POWERBI, this study examines the connection between feature adoption and user behavior, including:
- Weekly retention trends
- Average time spent on the platform
- Subscription plan changes
- Segmented user growth and loyalty patterns

📌 The dataset was **cleaned, organized, and analyzed using SQL**, then **visualized in Power BI** to create an interactive and actionable user retention dashboard.

---

## 🧩 Business Problem
- Behavioral traits linked to higher retention
- To what extent the adoption of specific features contributes to users staying active and loyal over time
- Chances to prompt users toward continuous interaction over an extended period.

---

## 🎯 Objective
The main goal is to uncover how feature adoption influences user lifecycle metrics by analyzing:
- Weekly retention curves
- Platform usage time per cohort
- Plan upgrades, downgrades, and renewals
- Monthly signup segmentation between loyal and growing users

## 🔍 Insights

- **Adopters consistently outperform** non-adopters in retention across all weeks.
- **Significant drop off** in non-adopter retention after Week 3 (down to 42.12% by Week 6).
- **Adopters maintain a steady engagement**, with minimal decline from Week 0 to Week 6.
- **Weekly active time** favors adopters after Week 3, indicating growing loyalty.
- **Plan stability** is higher in adopters fewer cancellations and more upgrades.
- **Loyal user segments** are slightly more prominent in non-adopters but are likely less active based on time metrics.

---

## 💥 Impact

- Strengthening adoption of valuable features directly correlates with longer platform engagement.
- Clear signals show adopters are more inclined to stick with or upgrade their plans.
- Non-adopters show vulnerability to churn, especially after Week 3.

---

## ✅ Recommendations

1. **Enhance Feature Onboarding**: Introduce guided walkthroughs and tooltips for key features.
2. **Re-engagement Campaigns**: Target non-adopters by showcasing benefits of underutilized features.
3. **Behavior-Based Segmentation**: Use plan change and time-spent patterns to predict and prevent churn.

---

## 📦 Conclusion

This analysis confirms that **feature adoption is a strong predictor of retention and engagement**. Strategic focus on encouraging adoption can lead to improved user experience, reduced churn, and higher revenue potential through plan upgrades and sustained activity.
